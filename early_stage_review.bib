The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν=0 and ν=±1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on ν mod 16, whereas ν itself governs edge thermal transport.

	abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized “Wannier functions” was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or “Boys orbitals” as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

	abstract = {A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp\{iγ(C)\} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

The aim is to provide a basic understanding of edge states, bulk topological invariants, and of the bulk--boundary correspondence with as simple mathematical tools as possible. The present approach uses noninteracting lattice models of topological insulators, building gradually on these to arrive from the simplest one-dimensional case (the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene) to two-dimensional time-reversal invariant topological insulators (the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for HgTe). In each case the discussion of simple toy models is followed by the formulation of the general arguments regarding topological insulators. The only prerequisite for the reader is a working knowledge in quantum mechanics, the relevant solid state physics background is provided as part of this self-contained text, which is complemented by end-of-chapter problems.},

These 'Berry phases' describe the global phase acquired by a quantum state as the Hamiltonian is changed. Beginning at an elementary level, this book provides a pedagogical introduction to the important role of Berry phases and curvatures, and outlines their great influence upon many key properties of electrons in solids, including electric polarization, anomalous Hall conductivity, and the nature of the topological insulating state. It focuses on drawing connections between physical concepts and provides a solid framework for their integration, enabling researchers and students to explore and develop links to related fields. Computational examples and exercises throughout provide an added dimension to the book, giving readers the opportunity to explore the central concepts in a practical and engaging way.},

The same quantity is ill-defined for an extended system, whose wave function invariably obeys periodic (Born–von Kármán) boundary conditions. Despite this fact, macroscopic polarization is a theoretically accessible quantity, for either uncorrelated or correlated many-electron systems: in both cases, polarization is a rather “exotic” observable. For an uncorrelated—either Hartree–Fock or Kohn–Sham—crystalline solid, polarization has been expressed and computed as a Berry phase of the Bloch orbitals (since 1993). The case of a correlated and/or disordered system received a definitive solution only very recently (1998): This latest development allows us to present here the whole theory from a novel, and very general, viewpoint. The modern theory of polarization is even relevant to the foundations of density functional theory in extended systems. ©1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 75: 599–606, 1999},

In the complex plane, they are branches of multivalued analytic and periodic functions, ϕk, and Ek, with branch points, k′, off the real axis. A simple procedure is described for locating the branch points. Application is made to the power series and Fourier series developments of these functions. The analyticity and periodicity of ϕn,k has some consequences for the form of the Wannier functions. In particular, it is shown that for each band there exists one and only one Wannier function which is real, symmetric or antisymmetric under an appropriate reflection, and falling off exponentially with distance. The rate of falloff is determined by the distance of the branch points k′ from the real axis.},

For a large class of potentials, two properties concerning the subspaces S(K) which are associated with a fixed band B have been proved for n-dimensional crystals. (1) The projection operator P(K) on S(K) can be defined for complex values of K, and its matrix elements ⟨r{\textbar}P(K){\textbar}r′⟩ are analytic in a strip of the complex K space; this strip is centered on the real K space and is independent of r and r'. (2) The projection operator P=∫dhKP(K) (integration on the Brillouin zone) has matrix elements ⟨r{\textbar}P{\textbar}r′⟩ which decrease exponentially when the length{\textbar}r-r′{\textbar} goes to infinity.},
